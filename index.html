  <h1> <b> The basics of the Web and HTML</b> </h1>
  <h2> 1. The basics of the Web </h2>
  <h3> <b> World Wide Web </b> </h3>
  <p> The World Wide Web is a collection of <b> HTML </b> documents. <b>HTML </b> is the basis for almost every webpage and the links between the pages called hyperlinks.  </p>
<p><em>Major pieces of the web:</em> <br>- HTTP : The main protocol of the web<br>
- Servers : Computers that host the files that make up the web <br>
- Internet : The world's largest computer network<br>
- Brower : A program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web  </p> 
<h2>2. HTML</h2>  
<b> <em>HTML </b></em> stands for <b> HyperText Markup Language </b> 
<p> HTML is made up of:</p>
- text content <br>
- markup <br>
- references to other documents <br>
- links to other pages<br>
<h3><em><b> HTML Markup:</em></b> </h3>
HTML markup is made up of things called tags. An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets(< >). Most tags have an opening tag  and closing tag .Some tags do not require a closing tag called "void" tag.<br><br>
<span><b> * b- Tag: </span></b> Anything that appers inside the b-tag appears <b> bold </b>. <br>
<span><b> * em- Tag:</span> </b> This tag makes things  <em> italics  </em>.<br><br>
    <h3><em><b> HTML Attributes:</em></b></h3>
Attribute is a property of an<b> HTML</b> element*.<br> * Element  refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.<br>
<p>HTML tags can have attributes that determine the behaviour of the tag.</p>
<p>
		An example of a tag that uses attributes is the anchor tag : href<br>
  Another tag that uses attributes is the image tag: src</p>
<span>		I am going to learn <a href ="www.udacity.com">HTML</a>. Here, the 'HTML' text will appear in blue and underlined indicaInting that the text is hyperlinked, i.e. by clicking on the text, the user will be taken to www.udacity.com<br><br>
  <img src =" http://www.uacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png" alt="Hipmunk!">
Here, the 'src' attribute indicates the source of the image, i.e. website address, and the 'alt' attribute indicates the text that should appear in case the image cannot be accessed.<br><br>
  <b>Whitespace:</b>
		All     spaces in text,    whitespaces, are largely ignored in HTML.To force out HTML to have multiple lines we can use break tag and paragraph tag.<br>
  <h3> Inline vs. block tags </h3>
  <div>
  - Inline : Shows texts inline.<br>
- Block : Elements are in an invisible box.</div>
